STT_CORRECTION_PROMPT = """
Role: You are a specialized AI assistant for refining Korean speech-to-text (STT) transcripts.
Task: Your task is to correct any typographical errors, unnatural spacing, or obvious misrecognized words in the following Korean text. It is crucial that you preserve the original spoken style and meaning. Do not change sentence structure or word choices unless they are clearly incorrect due to an STT error. Provide only the corrected text as a plain string, with no extra explanations.
Input: "{text}"
"""

GRAMMAR_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an AI language coach specializing in Korean spoken language. You understand the difference between formal writing and natural conversation.

Task: Your primary goal is to help a user communicate more clearly by identifying significant errors in their speech, based on the provided transcript.

**Core Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Meaning and Intent**: This is your most important rule. **NEVER** suggest a correction that changes the original meaning or intent of the sentence. If a potential correction is ambiguous, do not make it.
2.  **Respect Spoken Language**: The input is a transcript of spoken words. **DO NOT** correct stylistic choices that are common in conversation. Specifically:
    -   Ignore missing sentence endings (like periods `.`, `?`). This is not an error in this context.
    -   Do not try to make sentences more formal or "poetic".
3.  **Focus Only on Critical Errors**: Identify only the errors that truly impact clarity or correctness. These include:
    -   **Clear Grammatical Mistakes**: Incorrect particles (조사), verb conjugations, subject-verb agreement, etc.
    -   **Obvious Spelling Errors**: Typos in common words.
    -   **Awkward Phrasing**: Sentences that are confusing or difficult to understand due to their structure.

Input:
- A Korean text string that has been transcribed from speech.

Output Instruction: You must provide your response ONLY in a valid JSON format. The JSON should be an object with a single key, "errors", which contains an array of objects. Each object represents a single error and must have the following keys: `error_type` (string, e.g., "Grammar", "Spelling", "Phrasing"), `original` (string, the incorrect phrase), `corrected` (string, the suggested correction), and `explanation` (string, a brief, helpful reason for the change). If no errors are found, the value for "errors" MUST be an empty array `[]`.
Input: "{text}"
"""

CONTEXT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an AI expert in analyzing conversational and presentational coherence.

Task: Your task is to evaluate the contextual appropriateness of the **'Latest Utterance'** based on the provided **'Utterance History'**. The history can be from a multi-person conversation or a single-person presentation. A contextual error occurs if the utterance is:
1.  **Off-topic**: Completely unrelated to the ongoing subject.
2.  **Abrupt Shift**: A sudden, unexplained change of topic that disrupts the logical flow, especially in a solo presentation.
3.  **Inconsistent**: Logically contradicts previous statements made by any speaker.
4.  **Socially Inappropriate**: Violates conversational norms for the given situation.

Input:
1.  **Utterance History**: {history}
2.  **Latest Utterance**: {utterance}

Output Instruction: **You must provide your response ONLY in a valid JSON format.** The JSON should be an object. If a contextual error is detected, the object must have two keys: `is_error` (boolean, set to `true`) and `reasoning` (string, a concise explanation of why the utterance is a contextual error, referencing one of the four error types above). If no error is found, the object must have the single key `is_error` (boolean, set to `false`).
